**How It Works**
Two ways to control your project's visibility:

1. **Set It From The Start**\
   When creating a new project, just select Public or Private right off the bat.

<img
  className="block dark:block"
  src="/images/privacycontrol.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

2. **Change Your Mind Later**
   Forgot to choose? No sweat. We've all been there.
   Head to your project page → Click the Visibility option in the top-left corner → Switch between Private/Public anytime.

<img
  className="block dark:block"
  src="/images/privacy-project.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

**Public Projects**
- Show off when you're ready to flex
- Get community feedback and props
- Build your reputation with actual working demos
- Let the world see your genius (when it's actually genius)

**Private Projects**
- Keep your experimental mess under wraps
- Share with specific collaborators only
- Perfect for those "it works on my machine" moments
