### What is Cloud Agent?

Real-time monitoring and analysis of your applicationâ€™s runtime behavior with intelligent error detection and performance profiling. Proactive issue identification with contextual debugging insights - your code gets a guardian angel that actually knows what itâ€™s doing. 

Follow these simple steps to activate real-time monitoring for your application:

#### **Step 1: Enable Runtime Scanner**

Click the **Runtime Scanner** toggle to activate Cloud Agent. The system needs a moment to initialize.

/>

#### **Step 2: Check Connection Status**

Once activated, Cloud Agent enters **monitoring mode** for real-time stability and performance tracking.

Look at the right side of your screen to check the Cloud Agent status:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Live** - Your app is successfully connected to our cloud sandbox

  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

- **ðŸ”´ Disconnected** - Network connection lost. Click **"Reconnect"** to restore the link

  className="block dark:block"
  src="/images/disconnected.jpg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

#### **Step 3: Monitor and Fix Runtime Errors**

When Runtime Scanner detects issues during app execution, they'll appear in the **Runtime Scanner** section.

You have three options:

- **Fix All** - Automatically resolve all detected errors at once
- **Expand & Fix Individual Issues** - Click on a specific error, then hit **"Fix Now"** for targeted repairs
- **Dismiss** - Ignore the error if you don't want to address it right now

  title={true}
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

#### **Step 4: Verify Success**

After successful fixes, your Runtime Scanner should show a clean slate - no errors detected. Your app is now running smoothly under Cloud Agent's watchful eye.

<Note>
  **What's a Cloud Sandbox?** Think of it as a secure, isolated environment in the cloud where your app can run and be monitored safely. It's like having a dedicated testing room that watches every move your code makes and reports back instantly.
