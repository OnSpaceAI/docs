### **How Credit Rollovers Work**

Never lose your unused credits! OnSpace AI automatically rolls over all unused monthly credits at the end of each billing cycle for both monthly and annual paid plans, as long as you maintain an active subscription.

### **Important Notes**

**Active Subscription Required**

- Credit rollovers only apply while your subscription remains active
- Keep your plan current to enjoy this benefit

**Cancellation Policy**

- Upon cancellation of a paid subscription, all unused and rollover credits will expire at the end of the current billing period
- Credits will not carry over after subscription termination
