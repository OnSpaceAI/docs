### Step 1: Design and plan

- An [Onspace.ai](http://Onspace.ai) account ([sign up for free](https://onspace.ai/))
- A clear idea of what functionality you want to build
- Basic understanding of your target users

OnSpace AI offers flexible input methods to capture your app ideas:

- **Natural language prompts**Â - Simply describe your concept
- **File attachments**Â - Upload reference materials, sketches, or mockups
- **Figma integration(coming soon)**Â - Import designs directly from your Figma workspace

While you can begin with a broad request like "Build me a fitness tracking app," you'll achieve better results by planning ahead. Consider these key questions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's your core concept?">
    Define your mobile application categoryâ€”whether it's a habit tracker, social networking app, fitness companion, or productivity tool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who's your target user?">
    Understanding your audience drives smart design decisions. Consider their needs, preferences, and how they'll interact with your mobile app throughout their day.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What capabilities will it offer?">
    Map out specific user actions. For a fitness tracking app, this might include:

    - Workout logging and creation
    - Progress photo uploads
    - Social sharing features
    - Push notification reminders
    - Offline workout access
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's your visual direction?">
    Communicate your desired aesthetic through descriptions or visual referencesâ€”minimalist, vibrant, sporty, calming, etc. Consider how it will look on both light and dark mobile themes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How will users access it?">
    OnSpace AI specializes in mobile app development using React Native and Expo, enabling you to:

    - Cross-platform deployment: Build once, deploy to both iOS and Android
    - Native performance: Deliver smooth, responsive mobile experiences
    - App store distribution: Package for Apple App Store and Google Play Store

Sampleï¼š
I want to create a meditation app for college students dealing with stress and anxiety. Key features include: guided meditation sessions, breathing exercises, mood tracking, study break reminders, and offline content access. The design should be calming with soft purple/blue gradients and nature imagery. This will be a mobile app that students install on their phones, so please optimize for touch interactions and use Expo for seamless iOS and Android deployment.
```

### Step 2: Your first prompt

**Crafting effective prompts is essential for getting the best results from AI tools.**

If you've already drafted answers to the questions above, you can use them as the foundation for your first prompt.Â Enter your initial idea, andÂ **OnSpace**Â will take care of the rest\! This is your starting point for any project inÂ **OnSpace**, where you can instantly bring your ideas to life

### Step 3: **Refine your build**

FollowingÂ **OnSpace's**Â initial application generation from your foundational prompt, you'll likely enter an enhancement cycle requiring:

- **Feature augmentation**Â (modular expansion of capabilities)
- **Behavioral/UI parameter tuning**Â (granular adjustment of functional or aesthetic outputs)
- **Anomaly resolution**Â (systematic debugging of generated artifacts)

**Critical Implementation Note:**

Employ aÂ _single-parameter modification protocol_Â - address one enhancement vector per iteration cycle. Parallel modification attempts may introduce compounding variables that degrade output fidelity.
