### Storage

OnSpace Storage provides a comprehensive solution for managing all your digital assets, simplifying file operations without needing to write complex code.
*   **Storage Buckets:** All your files are stored securely within dedicated project buckets. Each file gets a unique URL or reference, allowing you to easily link them within your application.
*   **Secure Access:** OnSpace automatically generates secure URLs for your files and handles permission management, ensuring your data is protected yet accessible when needed.

#### Specifications

*   **File Size Limit:** Supports individual files up to 2 GB, accommodating a wide range of media and data.
*   **File Types:** Compatible with all common file formats, including images, videos, documents, and various static assets.
*   **Security:** Benefit from enterprise-grade encryption for data at rest and in transit, along with robust access controls to keep your files secure.

### Edge Functions
OnSpace Edge Functions empower you to execute serverless logic that automatically scales with your project's demands. Focus on building powerful features without the hassle of server provisioning or management.

*   **Serverless Logic:** Deploy custom code for your APIs, automate workflows for backend tasks, or implement advanced features, all without maintaining any servers.
*   **Automatic Scaling:** Your functions automatically scale up or down based on traffic, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency, even during peak loads.

#### Common Use Cases

*   **AI-Powered Features:** Integrate sophisticated AI capabilities, such as AI summaries or chatbots, leveraging OnSpace's built-in AI.
*   **Communication:** Automate sending emails, SMS, or push notifications to your users.
*   **Payment Processing:** Seamlessly integrate with payment gateways like Stripe for secure and efficient transaction handling.
*   **Automation:** Schedule and run background jobs or other automated tasks to keep your application running smoothly.
*   **External Integrations:** Handle heavy computations, call external APIs, or process webhooks without impacting your main application's performance.

#### Key Features

*   **Easy Creation:** Simply describe the function you need in the OnSpace AI chat, and we'll help you generate the code.
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Functions are designed to scale instantly and automatically to match your traffic, ensuring high availability and performance.

### AI Services
At OnSpace, we believe AI should be a core component of modern applications. Our platform comes with integrated AI capabilities, powered by OnSpace AI, enabling you to swiftly integrate intelligent features that enhance your app's functionality and user engagement.

#### AI-Powered Features

OnSpace AI provides out-of-the-box functionalities and tools to build custom AI solutions:

*   **AI Image Generation & Editing:** Build features that turn simple user photos into professional ID photos or headshots. Or, empower users to generate unique graphics, product mockups, and artistic visuals just by describing them in text.
*   **AI Video Generation:** Enable users to create dynamic short-form videos from scratch. For example, build a tool that generates a compelling UGC-style video ad from a product description and a few images, complete with an AI-generated voiceover.
*   **Advanced AI Agents & Personas:** Build specialized AI chatbots that go beyond simple Q&A. Create an AI legal assistant that drafts contracts, a virtual travel agent that plans itineraries, or a brand persona that interacts with customers in a specific voice.

### Secrets Management
OnSpace Secrets Management provides a robust and secure way to handle your application's sensitive environment variables, keeping them safe from exposure and simplifying their integration.

#### How It Works
1.  **Centralized Secure Storage:** Store critical credentials like API keys, tokens, and database passwords in a dedicated, encrypted environment. Your secrets are protected with robust encryption both when they are saved (at rest) and when they are being used (in transit).
2.  **Intelligent On-Demand Access:** When an OnSpace feature or an Edge Function in your project requires a secret, our platform automatically detects this need. It then securely prompts you via a safe user interface to provide the necessary information, ensuring you maintain control.
3.  **Automatic & Secure Injection:** Once configured, your secrets are never directly part of your codebase. Instead, OnSpace automatically and securely injects them into your Edge Functions and integrated services exactly when they are needed for execution, abstracting away sensitive details.
4.  **Eliminate Hardcoding Risks:** This entire process prevents the dangerous practice of hardcoding sensitive data into your application. It acts as a critical barrier against accidental exposure in your source code, version control, or logs.

### Logs & Monitoring
OnSpace's Logs & Monitoring features provide you with a powerful, centralized hub to observe, understand, and troubleshoot your application in real-time. Gain deep visibility into every process, from user interactions to serverless function executions.

#### How It Works
*   **Real-time Activity Stream:** See a live feed of all application events, function calls, and user interactions as they happen.
*   **Error Tracking:** Automatically capture and aggregate errors, providing immediate alerts and detailed contexts for quick resolution.
*   **Performance Insight:** Monitor key metrics like function execution times, resource consumption, and API response latency to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
*   **Intuitive Debugging Interface:** Access detailed log messages, comprehensive stack traces, and execution payloads, making it easy to diagnose and fix issues without leaving the platform.
