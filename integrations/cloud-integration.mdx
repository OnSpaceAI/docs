### AI Services
At OnSpace, we believe AI should be a core component of modern applications. Our platform comes with integrated AI capabilities, powered by OnSpace AI, enabling you to swiftly integrate intelligent features that enhance your app's functionality and user engagement.

#### AI-Powered Features

OnSpace AI provides out-of-the-box functionalities and tools to build custom AI solutions:

*   **AI Image Generation & Editing:** Build features that turn simple user photos into professional ID photos or headshots. Or, empower users to generate unique graphics, product mockups, and artistic visuals just by describing them in text.
*   **AI Video Generation:** Enable users to create dynamic short-form videos from scratch. For example, build a tool that generates a compelling UGC-style video ad from a product description and a few images, complete with an AI-generated voiceover.
*   **Advanced AI Agents & Personas:** Build specialized AI chatbots that go beyond simple Q&A. Create an AI legal assistant that drafts contracts, a virtual travel agent that plans itineraries, or a brand persona that interacts with customers in a specific voice.
