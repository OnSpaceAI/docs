### **What's New**

OnSpace now lets you integrate Stripe payments directly into your projects through our AI-powered setup. No complex webhooks or manual configuration required.

### **How It Works**

Simply connect your Stripe account and describe what payment features you need. OnSpace AI generates all the necessary payment logic, components, and backend integration automatically.

### **Requirements**

Before integrating Stripe, ensure:

- Your project is active in OnSpace （Select ”OnSpace Cloud“）
- A **Stripe account** with test mode enabled
- Clear idea of your payment flow (one-time payments, subscriptions, etc.)

**Testing Note** Always test in Stripe Test Mode first. Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any 3-digit CVC, and any future date.

### **Quick Setup Steps**

1. **Describe Your Payment Needs**
   - Tell OnSpace AI what you want: "Add subscription tiers at \$9.99/month"
   - Or: "Create one-time payment for \$29.99 digital product"
   - Be specific about your pricing and payment flow
2. **AI Generates Everything**
   - Payment screens and components
   - Stripe SDK integration
   - Backend payment processing
   - Success/failure handling
3. **Test & Deploy**
   - Test payments in your preview
   - Deploy when ready for production
